Project Description:

  Our project is a space-like game similar to Space Invaders or Asteroids, and the objective is to survive as long as possible while shooting the enemy ships.

Instructions for Use:

* To install the necessary libraries, run "pip install google-auth", "pip install google-cloud-firestore", and "python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user" (the latter is only used for sound)
* Our project runs from main.py(command line: "python3 main.py")
* To move the player: use the arrow keys or w, a, s, and d
* To shoot, press the space bar
* The shortcut key for pause is p
* In PvP mode, Player 1 uses the arrow keys to move and space bar to shoot, and Player 2 uses w, a, s, and d to move and 0 to shoot

Notes:

* The game windows and widgets appear differently on Mac and Windows.
